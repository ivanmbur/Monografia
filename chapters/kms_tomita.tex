Now that we've discussed KMS states and the mathematical tool of Tomita-Takesaki theory we are ready to discuss their relationship. In this chapter we will prove the most important theorem of this work. In particular, we already saw that the only $(\tau,\beta)$-KMS state for Schrodinger's time evolution was the $\beta$-Gibbs state. The theorem we will prove will show that the only possible dynamical law $\tau$ which has the $\beta$-Gibbs state as a $(\tau,\beta)$-KMS state (equilibrium state) is Schrodinger's time evolution. In other words, we provide a derivation of Schrodinger's equation from the axiom of equilibrium described by $\beta$-Gibbs states.
