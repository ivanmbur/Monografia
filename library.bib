@book{Kardar2007,
abstract = {While many scientists are familiar with fractals, fewer are familiar with scale-invariance and universality which underly the ubiquity of their shapes. These properties may emerge from the collective behaviour of simple fundamental constituents, and are studied using statistical field theories. Initial chapters connect the particulate perspective developed in the companion volume, to the coarse grained statistical fields studied here. Based on lectures taught by Professor Kardar at MIT, this textbook demonstrates how such theories are formulated and studied. Perturbation theory, exact solutions, renormalization groups, and other tools are employed to demonstrate the emergence of scale invariance and universality, and the non-equilibrium dynamics of interfaces and directed paths in random media are discussed. Ideal for advanced graduate courses in statistical physics, it contains an integrated set of problems, with solutions to selected problems at the end of the book and a complete set available to lecturers at www.cambridge.org/9780521873413.},

@article{Qi2006,
abstract = {We prove a general theorem on the relation between the bulk topological quantum number and the edge states in two-dimensional insulators. It is shown that whenever there is a topological order in bulk, characterized by a nonvanishing Chern number, even if it is defined for a nonconserved quantity such as spin in the case of the spin Hall effect, one can always infer the existence of gapless edge states under certain twisted boundary conditions that allow tunneling between edges. This relation is robust against disorder and interactions, and it provides a unified topological classification of both the quantum (charge) Hall effect and the quantum spin Hall effect. In addition, it reconciles the apparent conflict between the stability of bulk topological order and the instability of gapless edge states in systems with open boundaries (a known happening in the spin Hall case). The consequences of time reversal invariance for bulk topological order and edge state dynamics are further studied in the present framework. {\textcopyright} 2006 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {With the spinor analysis developed by B. van der Waerden which comprises all representations of the Lorentz group, even those not contained in ordinary tensor calculus, one is able to write all derivations and equations in an automatically covariant form. For the convenient translation into spinor language of the Maxwell equations, it becomes important to introduce three self-dual tensors, one representing the electromagnetic field, one corresponding to the Hertzian vector, and one representing a kind of current potential. These correspond to symmetric spinors of the 2nd rank. Many spinor equations thus become simpler than the corresponding tensorial equations, especially the expression for the stress energy tensor. From the 1st order Dirac equations in spinor form, as given by v.d. Waerden, we derived the 2nd order equation, which agrees with the Gordon-Klein form but for a correction term which again contains the self-dual field tensor. Further the expression for the current was derived, and its decomposition into conduction and polarization currents, and both Maxwell and Dirac equations were derived from a spinorial variation principle, analogous to the results of Gordon and Darwin. In addition to the divergence condition for the current three new invariant relations between the wave functions which are independent of the potentials were obtained (Chapter III, Eqs. (11), (12) and (13)).},

abstract = {The mathematics of classical probability theory was subsumed into classical measure theory by Kolmogorov in 1933. Quantum theory as nonclassical probability theory was incorporated into the beginnings of noncommutative measure theory by von Neumann in the early 1930s, as well. To precisely this end, von Neumann initiated the study of what are now called von Neumann algebras and, with Murray, made a first classification of such algebras into three types. The nonrelativistic quantum theory of systems with finitely many degrees of freedom deals exclusively with type I algebras. However, for the description of further quantum systems, the other types of von Neumann algebras are indispensable. The paper reviews quantum probability theory in terms of general von Neumann algebras, stressing the similarity of the conceptual structure of classical and noncommutative probability theories and emphasizing the correspondence between the classical and quantum concepts, though also indicating the nonclassical nature of quantum probabilistic predictions. In addition, differences between the probability theories in the type I, II and III settings are explained. A brief description is given of quantum systems for which probability theory based on type I algebras is known to be insufficient. These illustrate the physical significance of the previously mentioned differences. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The algebraic approach to quantum physics emphasizes the role played by the structure of the algebra of observables and its relation to the space of states. An important feature of this point of view is that subsystems can be described by subalgebras, with partial trace being replaced by the more general notion of restriction to a subalgebra. This, in turn, has recently led to applications to the study of entanglement in systems of identical particles. In the course of those investigations on entanglement and particle identity, an emergent gauge symmetry has been found by Balachandran, de Queiroz and Vaidya. In this letter we establish a novel connection between that gauge symmetry, entropy production and quantum operations. Thus, let A be a system described by a finite dimensional observable algebra and {\$}\backslashomega{\$} a mixed faithful state. Using the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) representation we construct a canonical purification of {\$}\backslashomega{\$}, allowing us to embed A into a larger system C. Using Tomita-Takasaki theory, we obtain a subsystem decomposition of C into subsystems A and B, without making use of any tensor product structure. We identify a group of transformations that acts as a gauge group on A while at the same time giving rise to entropy increasing quantum operations on C. We provide physical means to simulate this gauge symmetry/quantum operation duality.},

This allows a purely algebraic formulation of the theory. The framework of an algebraic version of quantum field theory is discussed and compared to the customary operator approach. It is pointed out that one reason (and possibly the only one) for the existence of unitarily inequivalent faithful, irreducible representations in quantum field theory is the (physically irrelevant) behavior of the states with respect to observations made infinitely far away. The separation between such ``global{\&}apos;{\&}apos; features and the local ones is studied. An application of this point of view to superselection rules shows that, for example, in electrodynamics the Hilbert space of states with charge zero carries already all the relevant physical information.},

abstract = {Attenuation is the reduction of the intensity of an x-ray beam as it traverses matter. The reduction may be caused by absorption or by deflection (scatter) of photons from the beam and can be affected by different factors such as beam energy and atomic number of the absorber. An attenuation coefficient is a measure of the quantity of radiation attenuation by a given thickness of absorber. Linear and mass attenuation coefficients are the coefficients used most often. The equation I = Ioe-mu x expresses the exponential relationship between incident primary photons and transmitted photons for a monoenergetic beam with respect to the thickness of the absorber and thus may be used to calculate the attenuation by any thickness of material. The quality or penetrating ability of an x-ray beam is usually described by stating its half-value layer (HVL). Another parameter used to describe the penetrating ability of a beam is the homogeneity coefficient. Among other things, use of added filtration reduces the intensity of the x-ray beam, increases the HVL, decreases patient exposure, and improves image quality for a given radiation dose.},

The idea is to develop a formalism that treats dependent and independent variables on the same footing. In short, I propose to interpret mechanics as a theory of relations between variables, rather than the theory of the evolution of variables in time.},

As pointed out to us by Sorkin, this happens if the GNS representation (of the algebra of observables in some quantum state) is reducible, and some representations in the decomposition occur with non-trivial degeneracy. This non-unique entropy can occur at zero temperature. We will argue elsewhere in detail that the degeneracies in the GNS representation can be interpreted as an emergent broken gauge symmetry, and play an important role in the analysis of emergent entropy due to non-Abelian anomalies. Finally, we establish the analogue of an H-theorem for this entropy by showing that its evolution is Markovian, determined by a stochastic matrix.},

abstract = {These lectures are intended as an introduction to the technique of path integrals and their applications in physics. The audience is mainly first-year graduate students, and it is assumed that the reader has a good foundation in quantum mechanics. No prior exposure to path integrals is assumed, however. The path integral is a formulation of quantum mechanics equivalent to the standard formulations, offering a new way of looking at the subject which is, arguably, more intuitive than the usual approaches. Applications of path integrals are as vast as those of quantum mechanics itself, including the quantum mechanics of a single particle, statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics and quantum field theory. After an introduction including a very brief historical overview of the subject, we derive a path integral expression for the propagator in quantum mechanics, including the free particle and harmonic oscillator as examples. We then discuss a variety of applications, including path integrals in multiply-connected spaces, Euclidean path integrals and statistical mechanics, perturbation theory in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory, and instantons via path integrals. For the most part, the emphasis is on explicit calculations in the familiar setting of quantum mechanics, with some discussion (often brief and schematic) of how these ideas can be applied to more complicated situations such as field theory.},

abstract = {{In these lecture notes prepared for the 11th Taiwan Spring School, Taipei 1997{\}}, and updated for the Saalburg summer school 1998, we review the solutions of O(N) or U(N) models in the large N limit and as 1/N expansions, in the case of vector representations. The general idea is that invariant composite fields have small fluctuations for N large. Therefore the method relies on constructing effective field theories for these composite fields after integration over the initial degrees of freedom. We illustrate these ideas by showing that the large N expansion allows to relate the phib{\^{}}2{\^{}}2 theory and the non-linear sigma-model, models which are renormalizable in different dimensions. In the same way large N techniques allow to relate the Gross--Neveu, an example of a theory with four-fermi self-interaction, with a Yukawa-type theory renormalizable in four dimensions, a topic relevant for four dimensional field theory. Among other issues for which large N methods are also useful we will briefly discuss finite size effects and finite temperature field theory, because they involve a crossover between different dimensions.$\backslash$par Finally we consider the case of a general scalar V(phib{\^{}}2) field theory, explain how the large N techniques can be generalized, and discuss some connected issues like tricritical behaviour and double scaling limit. Some sections in these notes are directly adapted from the work Zinn-Justin J., 1989, Quantum Field Theory and Critical Phenomena, Clarendon Press (Oxford third ed. 1996).},

@article{Balachandran2011,
abstract = {There are several instances where quantum anomalies of continuous and discrete classical symmetries play an important role in fundamental physics. Examples come from chiral anomalies in the Standard Model of fundamental interactions and gravitational anomalies in string theories. Their generic origin is the fact that classical symmetries may not preserve the domains of quantum operators like the Hamiltonian. In this work, we show by simple examples that anomalous symmetries can often be implemented at the expense of working with mixed states having non-zero entropies. In particular there is the result on color breaking by non-abelian magnetic monopoles. This anomaly can be rectified by using impure states. We also argue that non-abelian groups of twisted bundles are always anomalous for pure states sharpening an earlier argument of Sorkin and Balachandran. This is the case of mapping class groups of geons indicating that "large" diffeos are anomalous for pure states in the presence of geons. Nevertheless diffeo invariance may be restored by using impure states. This work concludes with examples of these ideas drawn from molecular physics. The above approach using impure states is entirely equivalent to restricting all states to the algebra of observables invariant under the anomalous symmetries. For anomalous gauge groups such as color, this would mean that we work with observables singlet under global gauge transformations. For color, this will mean that we work with color singlets, a reasonable constraint.},

abstract = {We give a comprehensive review of various methods to define currents and the energy-momentum tensor in classical field theory, with emphasis on a geometric point of view. The necessity of "improving" the expressions provided by the canonical Noether procedure is addressed and given an adequate geometric framework. The main new ingredient is the explicit formulation of a principle of "ultralocality" with respect to the symmetry generators, which is shown to fix the ambiguity inherent in the procedure of improvement and guide it towards a unique answer: when combined with the appropriate splitting of the fields into sectors, it leads to the well-known expressions for the current as the variational derivative of the matter field Lagrangian with respect to the gauge field and for the energy-momentum tensor as the variational derivative of the matter field Lagrangian with respect to the metric tensor. In the second case, the procedure is shown to work even when the matter field Lagrangian depends explicitly on the curvature, thus establishing the correct relation between scale invariance, in the form of local Weyl invariance "on shell", and tracelessness of the energy-momentum tensor, required for a consistent definition of the concept of a conformal field theory. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

However, while the use of func- tions in classical theories is founded on premises which seem intuitively quite clear, in quantum theory the situation with operators is different. Historically the “matrix mechanics” of Heisenberg and the “wave mechanics” of Schr¨odinger which gave rise to the contemporary form of quantum theory, originated from ingenious attempts to t mathemat- ical objects able to reect some unusual (from the macroscopic point of view) features of microparticle behavior – in particular, a peculiar combination of continuous and discrete properties. The “probabilistic interpretation” developed later by Born and others elucidated the mean- ing of operator formalism by postulating rules connecting mathematical objects with observable quantities. However a good deal of arbitrari- ness remained in these postulates and the most convincing argument for quantum-theoretical explanations was still the “striking” coincidence of theoretical predictions with experimental data. This state of affairs gave rise to numerous attempts, on one hand, to nd classical alternatives to quantum theory which would give an equally satisfactory description of the experimental data, and on the other hand, to nd out physical and philosophical arguments for justifying the inevitability of the new me- chanics. Notwithstanding the impressive philosophical achievements in this eld there was and still is a need for the structural investigation of quan- tum theory from a more mathematical point of view aimed at elucidating the connections between the entities of the physical world and the ele- ments of operator formalism. The present book is essentially in this line of research opened by the classical von Neumann's treatise “Mathemati- cal Foundations of Quantum Mechanics”. However it differs from most subsequent investigations by the strong emphasis on the statistical rather than “logical” essence of quantum theory; it gives an account of recentxiv Alexander Holevo progress in the statistical theory of quantum measurement, stimulated by the new applications of quantum mechanics, particularly in quantum op- tics. The rst three chapters give an introduction to the foundations of quan- tum mechanics, addressed to the reader interested in the structure of quantum theory and its relations with classical probability. In spite of the mathematical character of the presentation it is not “axiomatic”. Its purpose is to display the origin of the basic elements of operator formal- ism resting, as far as possible, upon the classical probabilistic concepts. The present revision is not an end in itself – it emerged from the so- lution of concrete problems concerning the quantum limitations to mea- surement accuracy, arising in applications. So far there has been no gen- eral approach to such kind of problems. The methods of mathemati- cal statistics adapted for classical measurements required radial quantum modication. The last chapters of the book are devoted to the recently developed quantum estimation theory, which is an analog of the corre- sponding branch of mathematical statistics. We now give a more detailed account of the contents of the book. In Chapter 1 the general concepts of state and measurement are introduced on the basis of statistical analysis of an experimental situation. From the very beginning this approach leads to a substantial generalization of the Dirac-von Neumann concept of an observable. Mathematically it is re- ected by the occurrence of arbitrary resolutions of identity in place of or- thogonal ones (spectral measures) and the repudiation of self-adjointness as an indispensable attribute of an observable. In this way nonorthog- onal resolutions of identity like the “overcomplete” system of coherent states known in physics for rather a long time nd their proper place in quantum phenomenology. The new concept of quantum measurement is central for the whole book. The notion of statistical model exploited in Chapter 1 is quite general and may nd applications different from quantum theory. It gives us a new insight into the still controversial “hidden variables” problem. In Chapter 2 the elements of operator theory in Hilbert space are intro- duced to provide mathematical background for the subsequent material. As compared to standard presentations relatively much attention is paid to nonorthogonal resolutions of identity and related questions. A novel feature is also the introduction of the L 2 spaces of observables associ- ated with a quantum state and playing a role similar to the Hilbert space of random variables with nite second moment in probability theory. These L 2 spaces give the framework for a calculus of unbounded operators. Of fundamental importance to quantum theory are groups of symme- tries. In Chapter 3 elementary quantum mechanics is considered from thisxv Probabilistic and Statistical Aspects of Quantum Theory point of view. An important result of this discussion is the isolation of the notion of covariant measurement which ties physical quantities with cer- tain classes of resolutions of identity in the underlying Hilbert space. In this way we construct quantum measurements canonically corresponding to such quantities as time, phase of harmonic oscillator, angle of rotation and joint measurement of coordinate and velocity. Allowing the broader concept of quantum measurement enables us to resolve old troubles of quantum theory connected with the non-existence of self-adjoint opera- tors having the required covariance properties. Chapter 4 is devoted to a more advanced study of covariant measure- ments and extreme quantum limits for the accuracy of estimation of phys- ical parameters. The latter problem becomes important in view of the progress in experimental physics. We present a unied statistical ap- proach to “non-standard” uncertainty relations of the “angle-angular mo- mentum” type. They appear to be related to the quantum analog of the Hunt-Stein theorem in mathematical statistics. A general conclusion which can be drawn from Chapter 4 is that the requirements of covariance and optimality, i.e., extremal quantum accuracy, determine the canoni- cal measurement of a “shift” parameter, such as angle, coordinate, time, uniquely up to a “gauge” transformation. An example of a situation where quantum limitations are important is provided by optical communication. As it is known, “quantum noise” dis- torting the signal in the optical range can be much more signicant than the thermal background radiation. As in ordinary communication theory the problem of signal estimation arises, but now it requires a specically quantum-theoretic formulation and solution. Chapter 5 is devoted to the so-called Gaussian states which, in par- ticular, describe radiation elds in optical communication theory. The presentation is intended to make maximal use of the remarkable parallel with the Gaussian probability distributions. An important role is played here by quantum characteristic functions. In Chapter 6 the general inequalities for the measurement mean square errors are derived, which are quantum analogs of the well-known Cramer- Rao inequality in mathematical statistics. The best unbiased measure- ments of the mean-value parameters of a Gaussian state are describ- ed. Needless to say, the present book cannot (and is not intended to) re- place the standard textbooks on quantum mechanics. Most of the impor- tant topics, such as perturbation theory, are apparently out of its scope. Nor does it pretend to give a full account of quantum measurements. We have discussed only those problems which concern measurement statis- tics and do not require consideration of state changes after measurements.The references to the relevant work on “open” quantum systems and quantum stochastic processes can be found in the comments. The author's intention was to write a book accessible to a wide circle of readers, both mathematicians and physicists. As a result, the presenta- tion, being in general mathematical, is rather informal and certainly not “the most economic” from a mathematical point of view. On the other hand, it neglects some subtleties concerning measurability etc. As a rule a rigorous treatment can be found in the special papers refered to. The necessary background for the whole material is knowledge of fundamen- tals of probability theory. Mathematically the most elementary is Chapter 1 which uses mainly nite-dimensional linear analysis. The functional analytic minimum is given in Section 2.1-2.6 of Chapter 2, and a math- ematically educated reader may just glance over it. On the other hand, a reader familiar with quantum mechanics can omit the detailed discussion of such topics as harmonic oscillators and spin in Chapter 3, included to make the presentation self-contained, and concentrate on less familiar things. The Dirac notation is used intensively throughout the book but with round brackets for the inner product as accepted in mathematical litera- ture. The angle brackets, associated with the averaging symbol in statis- tical mechanics, are reserved for the different inner product dening the correlation of a pair of observables. To denote a quantum state as well as its density operator we use the letter S (not the usual $\rho$ ) allied to the notation P for the classical state (probability distribution). The author's thanks are due to Prof. D. P. Zelobenko and the late Prof. Yu. M. Shirokov who read the manuscript and made useful comments. In translating the book the author took the opportunity of improving the presentation which concerned mainly Chapters 3, 4. Few references were added. The author is grateful to Prof. Yu. A. Rozanov and Prof. P. R. Krishnaiah for providing the opportunity of translating this book for North-},

abstract = {One of von Neumann's motivations for developing the theory of operator algebras and his and Murray's 1936 classification of factors was the question of possible decompositions of quantum systems into independent parts. For quantum systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom the simplest possibility, i.e., factors of type I in the terminology of Murray and von Neumann, are perfectly adequate. In relativistic quantum field theory (RQFT), on the other hand, factors of type III occur naturally. The same holds true in quantum statistical mechanics of infinite systems. In this brief review some physical consequences of the type III property of the von Neumann algebras corresponding to localized observables in RQFT and their difference from the type I case will be discussed. The cumulative effort of many people over more than 30 years has established a remarkable uniqueness result: The local algebras in RQFT are generically isomorphic to the unique, hyperfinite type {\$}{\{}\backslashrm III{\}}{\_}{\{}1{\}}{\$} factor in Connes' classification of 1973. Specific theories are characterized by the net structure of the collection of these isomorphic algebras for different space-time regions, i.e., the way they are embedded into each other.},

By using the algebraic formulation of quantum theory, we propose a unifying perspective on these problems, based on the hypothesis that in a generally covariant quantum theory the physical time-flow is not a universal property of the mechanical theory, but rather it is determined by the thermodynamical state of the system ("thermal time hypothesis"). We implement this hypothesis by using a key structural property of von Neumann algebras: the Tomita-Takesaki theorem, which allows to derive a time-flow, namely a one-parameter group of automorphisms of the observable algebra, from a generic thermal physical state. We study this time-flow, its classical limit, and we relate it to various characteristic theoretical facts, as the Unruh temperature and the Hawking radiation. We also point out the existence of a state-independent notion of "time", given by the canonical one-parameter subgroup of outer automorphisms provided by the Cocycle Radon-Nikodym theorem.},

abstract = {In a quantum system, there may be many density matrices associated with a state on an algebra of observables. For each density matrix, one can compute its entropy. These are in general different. Therefore one reaches the remarkable possibility that there may be many entropies for a given state [Private communication from R. Sorkin]. This ambiguity in entropy can often be traced to a gauge symmetry emergent from the non-trivial topological character of the configuration space of the underlying system. It can also happen in finite-dimensional matrix models. In the present work, we discuss this entropy ambiguity and its consequences for an ethylene molecule. This is a very simple and well-known system where these notions can be put to tests. Besides its intrinsic conceptual interest, the simplicity of this model can serve as an introduction to a similar discussion of systems such as coloured monopoles and the breaking of colour symmetry.},

@article{Weingarten2016,
abstract = {Although quantum mechanics is fundamental for understanding molecular mechanisms in physics and chemistry, it has usually been assumed to be unimportant for understanding molecular mechanisms of biological systems. However, there is increasing evidence that quantum mechanics is important for understanding some biological phenomena (Lambert et al., 2013), such as energy transfer in photosynthesis (Fassioli et al., 2014), navigation by birds using the earth's magnetic field (Hiscock et al., 2016), and electron and hydrogen tunneling in biochemical reactions (Klinman and Kohen, 2013). There have also been proposals that quantum mechanics may help explain aspects of brain function. Discussions about quantum mechanics and the brain began with questions on the role of measurement or observation in quantum mechanics (Stapp, 1991; Theise and Kafatos, 2013). Further developments began to highlight the possibility that quantum mechanics might help explain neural mechanisms involved in consciousness or synaptic function (Stapp, 1991; Beck and Eccles, 1992). Another topic that emerged was whether quantum mechanisms might be employed by the brain to perform calculations, i.e., the possibility of quantum computing in the brain (Penrose, 1989). For example, a model of consciousness was developed that involves quantum computations in neuronal microtubules (Tegmark, 2000; Penrose and Hameroff, 2011; Hameroff and Penrose, 2014a,b; Reimers et al., 2014; Craddock et al., 2015). Other proposals have focused on the quantum phenomenon of spin (see below). Hu and Wu (2004) suggested that nuclear spins of hydrogen, nitrogen, and phosphorus in neuronal cellular components and electron spins of diffusible oxygen and nitric oxide in the brain might mediate consciousness. Electron spins in the brain have also been suggested as a potential target of transcranial magnetic stimulation therapies (Chervyakov et al., 2015). Other perspectives have led to application of quantum probability theory to human decision making (Wang et al., 2014; Kvam et al., 2015). Finally, the above mentioned navigation by birds may involve a quantum mechanical cryptochrome radical-pair (spin dynamic) mechanism in neuronal retinal ganglion cells that transmit information to the brain (Mouritsen et al., 2004; Hiscock et al., 2016). Recently a new model for how the brain may store and process quantum information has been proposed (Fisher, 2015). The model includes specific biochemical components that could be employed for quantum processing in glutamatergic neurotransmission. It has potential relevance for molecular mechanisms underlying normal neural function, such as glutamatergic dependent neurocognitive systems, as well as psychiatric treatments such as lithium.},

@article{Martinetti2013,
abstract = {We discuss the emergence of time in quantum gravity, and ask whether time is always "something that flows"'. We first recall that this is indeed the case in both relativity and quantum mechanics, although in very different manners: time flows geometrically in relativity (i.e. as a flow of proper time in the four dimensional space-time), time flows abstractly in quantum mechanics (i.e. as a flow in the space of observables of the system). We then ask the same question in quantum gravity, in the light of the thermal time hypothesis of Connes and Rovelli. The latter proposes to answer the question of time in quantum gravity (or at least one of its many aspects), by postulating that time is a state dependent notion. This means that one is able to make a notion of time-as-an-abstract-flow - that we call the thermal time - emerge from the knowledge of both: 1) the algebra of observables of the physical system under investigation, 2) a state of thermal equilibrium of this system. Formally, this thermal time is similar to the abstract flow of time in quantum mechanics, but we show in various examples that it may have a concrete implementation either as a geometrical flow, or as a geometrical flow combined with a non-geometric action. This indicates that in quantum gravity, time may well still be "something that flows" at some abstract algebraic level, but this does not necessarily imply that time is always and only "something that flows" at the geometric level.},

The key idea in controlled teleportation is that the teleportation is performed only with the participation of the controller. We calculate a quantitative measure of the controller's power and establish a lower bound on the control power required for controlled teleportation. We show that the maximally entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state is a suitable channel for controlled teleportation of arbitrary single qubits-the controller's power meets the bound and the teleportation fidelity without the controller's permission is no better than the fidelity of a classical channel. We also construct partially entangled channels that exceed the bound for controlled teleportation of a restricted set of states called the equatorial states. We calculate the minimum entanglement required in these channels to exceed the bound. Moreover, we find that in these restricted controlled teleportation schemes, the partially entangled channels can outperform maximally entangled channels with respect to the controller's power. Our results provide an alternative perspective on controlled teleportation schemes and are of practical interest since we propose useful partially entangled channels.},

This determines an expansion of the metric in powers of proper distance normal to the geodesic, of which the second-order terms are explicitly computed here in terms of the curvature tensor at the corresponding point on the base geodesic. These terms determine the lowest-order effects of a gravitational field which can be measured locally by a freely falling observer. An example is provided in the Schwarz schild metric. This dis-cussion of Fermi Normal Coordinate provides numerous examples of the use of the modern, co-ordinate-free concept of a vector and of computations which are simplified by introducing a vector instead of its components. The ideas of contravariant vector and Lie Bracket, as well as the equation of geodesic deviation, are reviewed before being applied.},

The modular flows associated with the algebras of the forward light cone and a space-like wedge admit a simple geometric description in two dimensional models that factorize in light-cone coordinates. At large distances from the domain boundary compared to the inverse temperature the flow pattern is essentially the same as time translations, whereas the zero temperature results are approximately reproduced close to the edge of the wedge and the apex of the cone. Associated with each domain there is also a one parameter group with a positive generator, for which the thermal state is a ground state. Formally, this may be regarded as a certain converse of the Unruh-effect.},

Una muestra cristalina s{\'{o}}lida o en polvo en polvo C, se monta sobre una mesa H, que puede girar alrededor de un eje O perpendicular al plano del dibujo. La fuente de rayos X es S y el blanco del tubo de rayos X es T. Los rayos X divergen desde la fuente y son difractados por la muestra para formar un haz difractado convergente que focaliza en la rendija F y luego ingresa al contador G. A y B son rendijas especiales que definen y coliman a los haces incidente y difractado. La rendija receptora F y el contador se soportan en un carril E que puede girar alrededor del eje O y cuya posici{\'{o}}n angular 2[ puede ser le{\'{i}}da sobre la escala graduada K. Los soportes E y H est{\'{a}}n acoplados mec{\'{a}}nicamente de tal forma que una rotaci{\'{o}}n del contador a trav{\'{e}}s de 2x grados es acompa{\~{n}}ada por la rotaci{\'{o}}n de la muestra a trav{\'{e}}s de x grados. Un motor produce el movimiento del contador a velocidad angular constante. 1.2. {\'{O}}PTICA DE LOS RAYOS X El funcionamiento de un difract{\'{o}}metro de rayos X, se basa en el Principio de focalizaci{\'{o}}n de BRAGG-BRENTANO. Este principio establece que para cualquier posici{\'{o}}n del sistema de detecci{\'{o}}n de rayos X, el diafragma receptor F del sistema de detecci{\'{o}}n y el diafragma de entrada S (o el foco del tubo de rayos X), est{\'{a}}n siempre localizados sobre un c{\'{i}}rculo denominado c{\'{i}}rculo difractom{\'{e}}trico. La muestra se monta de manera que pueda rotar y su superficie se ubica en el eje de rotaci{\'{o}}n de la muestra que es conc{\'{e}}ntrico al eje de rotaci{\'{o}}n del sistema detector. El haz primario divergente que incide sobre los planos difractantes de la red, bajo un {\'{a}}ngulo de Bragg $\theta$, es difractado bajo el mismo {\'{a}}ngulo, y debido al acoplamiento mec{\'{a}}nico del portamuestra con el sistema de detecci{\'{o}}n, los planos difractantes de la red siempre son tangentes a un c{\'{i}}rculo de focalizaci{\'{o}}n centrado sobre la normal a la muestra y que pasa a trav{\'{e}}s de F y S. El c{\'{i}}rculo de focalizaci{\'{o}}n no es de tama{\~{n}}o constante sino que incrementa su radio cuando el {\'{a}}ngulo de difracci{\'{o}}n 2$\theta$ disminuye, como se muestra en la Figura 1.2, para dos posibles reflexiones.

By using a quantum jump approach, we demonstrate that in the presence of quantum coherent energy transfer and energetic disorder, the efficiency of excitation transfer from the antenna to the reaction center depends intimately on the quantum superposition properties of the initial state. In particular, we find that efficiency is sensitive to symmetric and asymmetric superposition of states in the basis of localized excitations, indicating that initial-state properties can be used as an efficiency control parameter at low temperatures.},

The capability of controlling our channel allows us to visualize its effects in a quantum system. Differently from standard dephasing channels, our channel presents an exotic behavior in the sense that the evolution of a state, from a pure to a mixed state, shows an oscillatory behavior if tracked in the Bloch sphere. Additionally, we report the evolution of the purity and perform a quantum process tomography to obtain the $\backslash$chi matrix associated to our channel.},

abstract = {Topological quantum phases of matter are characterized by an intimate relationship between the Hamiltonian dynamics away from the edges and the appearance of bound states localized at the edges of the system. Elucidating this correspondence in the continuum formulation of topological phases, even in the simplest case of a one-dimensional system, touches upon fundamental concepts and methods in quantum mechanics that are not commonly discussed in textbooks, in particular the self-adjoint extensions of a Hermitian operator. We show how such topological bound states can be derived in a prototypical one-dimensional system. Along the way, we provide a pedagogical exposition of the self-adjoint extension method as well as the role of symmetries in correctly formulating the continuum, field-theory description of topological matter with boundaries. Moreover, we show that self-adjoint extensions can be characterized generally in terms of a conserved local current associated with the self-adjoint operator.},

@article{Mizera2019,
abstract = {We elaborate on the recent proposal that intersection numbers of certain cohomology classes on the moduli space of genus-zero Riemann surfaces with punctures compute tree-level scattering amplitudes in quantum field theories. The relevant cohomology classes are twisted by representations of the fundamental group that describes how punctures braid around each other on the Riemann surface, which can be used to link it to the space of kinematic invariants. Intersection numbers of said cohomology classes, whose representatives we call twisted forms, can be shown to fully localize on the boundaries of the moduli space, which are in one-to-one map with Feynman diagrams. We prove that when twisted forms are logarithmic, their intersection numbers have a simple expansion in terms of trivalent Feynman diagrams allowing only for massless propagators on the internal and external lines. For physical applications one also needs to study non-logarithmic forms as they are responsible for propagation of massive states. We utilize the natural fibre bundle structure of the moduli space, which allows for a direct access to the boundaries, to introduce recursion relations for intersection numbers that "integrate out" puncture-by-puncture. The resulting recursion involves only linear algebra of certain matrices describing braiding properties of the moduli space and evaluating one-dimensional residues, thus paving a way for explicit analytic computations of scattering amplitudes. Together with the previous reformulation of the tree-level S-matrix of string theory in terms of twisted forms, the results of this work complete a unified geometric framework for studying scattering amplitudes from genus-zero Riemann surfaces. We show that a web of dualities between different homology and cohomology groups allows for deriving a host of identities among various types of amplitudes computed from the moduli space.},

Some operator theory and a first exposure to von Neu-mann algebras After introducing concrete and abstract von Neumann alge-bras, we give a crash course on the two pillars of operator theory in Hilbert space: the spectral theorem and the polar decomposition theorem. And we finish with some basic von Neumann algebra theory. 3. Normality We discuss some of the equivalent descriptions of what it takes to belong to the pre-dual of a von Neumann algebra, as well as demonstrate the equivalence of the concrete and abstract descriptions of a von Neumann algebra. 4. The standard form of von Neumann algebras We discuss what may be considered the analogue in von Neu-mann algebra theory of the existence and uniquenes of Haar measure in the theory of locally compact groups. 5. The Tomita-Takesaki Theorem We discuss: states and weights, the GNS construction for weights, the Tomita-Takesaki theorem, modular automorphism groups, Connes' unitary cocycle theorem, ... 6.

These symmetries are spontaneously broken by the {\$}AdS{\_}2{\$} geometry and they are explicitly broken by the small deformation away from {\$}AdS{\_}2{\$}. This pattern of spontaneous plus explicit symmetry breaking governs the gravitational backreaction of the system. It determines several gravitational properties such as the linear in temperature dependence of the near extremal entropy as well as the gravitational corrections to correlation functions. These corrections include the ones determining the growth of out of time order correlators that is indicative of chaos. These gravitational aspects can be described in terms of a Schwarzian derivative effective action for a reparametrization.},

abstract = {We show that perfect quantum teleportation can be achieved with mixed photon polarization states when nonlocal memory effects influence the dynamics of the quantum system. The protocol is carried out with a pair of photons, whose initial maximally entangled state is destroyed by local decoherence prior to teleportation. It is demonstrated that the presence of strong nonlocal memory effects, which arise from initial correlations between the environments of the photons, allow to restore perfect teleportation. We further analyze how the amount of initial correlations within the environment affects the fidelity of the protocol, and find that for a moderate amount of correlations the fidelity exceeds the one of the previously known optimal teleportation protocol without memory effects. Our results show that memory effects can be exploited in harnessing noisy quantum systems for quantum communication and that non-Markovianity is a resource for quantum information tasks.},

In contrast to more standard treatments, Hilbert space is an emergent concept, appearing as a representation space of the observable algebra, once a state is chosen. In this approach, which is based on the Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal construction, the study of subsystems becomes particularly clear. We explicitly show how the problems associated with the partial trace for the study of entanglement of identical particles are readily overcome. In particular, a suitable entanglement measure is proposed that can be applied to systems of particles obeying Fermi, Bose, para-, and even braid-group statistics. The generality of the method is also illustrated by study of the time evolution of subsystems emerging from restriction to subalgebras. Problems related to anomalies and quantum epistemology are also discussed. DOI:},

This book introduces the main ideas of quantum mechanics in language familiar to mathematicians. Readers with little prior exposure to physics will enjoy the book's conversational tone as they delve into such topics as the Hilbert space approach to quantum theory; the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation in one space dimension; the Spectral Theorem for bounded and unbounded self-adjoint operators; the Stone–von Neumann Theorem; the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation; the role of Lie groups and Lie algebras in quantum mechanics; and the path-integral approach to quantum mechanics. The numerous exercises at the end of each chapter make the book suitable for both graduate courses and independent study. Most of the text is accessible to graduate students in mathematics who have had a first course in real analysis, covering the basics of L2 spaces and Hilbert spaces. The final chapters introduce readers who are familiar with the theory of manifolds to more advanced topics, including geometric quantization.},

Then they are generalised to being quantum reversible, i.e.{\$}\backslash{\$} unitary. (The classical networks we generalise are called feedforward, and have step-function activation functions.) The quantum network can be trained efficiently using gradient descent on a cost function to perform quantum generalisations of classical tasks. We demonstrate numerically that it can: (i) compress quantum states onto a minimal number of qubits, creating a quantum autoencoder, and (ii) discover quantum communication protocols such as teleportation. Our general recipe is theoretical and implementation-independent. The quantum neuron module can naturally be implemented photonically.},

abstract = {Quantum indistinguishability plays a crucial role in many low-energy physical phenomena, from quantum fluids to molecular spectroscopy. It is, however, typically ignored in most high temperature processes, particularly for ionic coordinates, implicitly assumed to be distinguishable, incoherent and thus well-approximated classically. We explore chemical reactions involving small symmetric molecules, and argue that in many situations a full quantum treatment of collective nuclear degrees of freedom is essential. Supported by several physical arguments, we conjecture a "Quantum Dynamical Selection" (QDS) rule for small symmetric molecules that precludes chemical processes that involve direct transitions from orbitally non-symmetric molecular states. As we propose and discuss, the implications of the Quantum Dynamical Selection rule include: (i) a differential chemical reactivity of para- and ortho-hydrogen, (ii) a mechanism for inducing inter-molecular quantum entanglement of nuclear spins, (iii) a new isotope fractionation mechanism, (iv) a novel explanation of the enhanced chemical activity of "Reactive Oxygen Species", (v) illuminating the importance of ortho-water molecules in modulating the quantum dynamics of liquid water, (vi) providing the critical quantum-to-biochemical linkage in the nuclear spin model of the (putative) quantum brain, among others.},

abstract = {With contributions by many of today's leading quantum physicists, philosophersand historians, including three Nobel laureates, this comprehensive A to Z ofquantum physics provides a lucid understanding of the key concepts of quantumtheory and experiment. It covers technical and interpretational aspects alike,and includes both traditional topics and newer areas such as quantuminformation and its relatives. The central concepts that have shapedcontemporary understanding of the quantum world are clearly defined, withillustrations where helpful, and discussed at a level suitable forundergraduate and graduate students of physics, history of science, andphilosophy of physics. All articles share three main aims: (1) to provide aclear definition and understanding of the term concerned; (2) where possible,to trace the historical origins of the concept; and (3) to provide a small butoptimal selection of references to the most relevant literature, includingpertinent historical studies. Also discussed are the often contentiousphilosophical implications derived from quantum theory and its associatedexperimental findings.This compendium will be an indispensable resource for all those seekingconcise up-to-date information about the many facets of quantum physics.},

As a main application we consider the perturbation theory for certain finite dimensional integrals within BV-formalism. As an illustration we present a proof of the isomorphism between the graph complex and the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of formal Hamiltonian vectors fields. We briefly discuss how these ideas can be extended to the infinite dimensional setting. These notes should be accessible to both physicists and mathematicians.},

This monograph presents a thoroughly modern framework to make linear response theory rigorous for a wide array of systems, that is suitable for novel applications such as periodic and random light conductors not yet covered in the literature. Our analytic-algebraic approach, based on von Neumann algebras and associated non-commutative {\$}L{\^{}}p{\$}-spaces, can deal with discrete and continuous models alike, and include effects of disorder. First, we explain the mathematical setting, give a complete list of our hypotheses and state the main results, which include Kubo and Kubo-Streda formulas. To make our book accessible to a wide audience, we spend Chapters 3 and 4 explaining the mathematical underpinnings such as non-commutative {\$}L{\^{}}p{\$}- and Sobolev spaces, and generalized commutators. Furthermore, we show how to construct a von Neumann algebras from a topological dynamical system and a 2-cocycle, a procedure which applies to discrete and continuous quantum systems. We dedicate Chapters 5 and 6 to the proofs of our main results. We close the book by sketching a novel application, linear response theory for periodic and random light conductors. This monograph is aimed at advanced students in mathematical physics and researchers.},

We concentrate on the case of nearly-{\$}AdS{\_}2{\$} gravity and discuss a very simple mechanical picture for the gravitational dynamics. We derive a formula for the two sided correlators that includes the effect of gravitational backreaction, which limits the amount of information we can send through the wormhole. We emphasize that the process can be viewed as a teleportation protocol where the teleportee feels nothing special as he/she goes through the wormhole. We discuss some applications to the cloning paradox for old black holes. We point out that the same formula we derived for {\$}AdS{\_}2{\$} gravity is also valid for the simple SYK quantum mechanical theory, around the thermofield double state. We present a heuristic picture for this phenomenon in terms of an operator growth model. Finally, we show that a similar effect is present in a completely classical chaotic system with a large number of degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {This talk reviews the constraints imposed by binary-pulsar data on gravity theories, focusing on ``tensor-scalar'' ones which are the best motivated alternatives to general relativity. We recall that binary-pulsar tests are qualitatively different from solar-system experiments, because of nonperturbative strong-field effects which can occur in compact objects like neutron stars, and because one can observe the effect of gravitational radiation damping. Some theories which are strictly indistinguishable from general relativity in the solar system are ruled out by binary-pulsar observations. During the last months, several impressive new experimental data have been published. Today, the most constraining binary pulsar is no longer the celebrated (Hulse-Taylor) PSR B1913+16, but the neutron star-white dwarf system PSR J1141-6545. In particular, in a region of the ``theory space'', solar-system tests were known to give the tightest constraints; PSR J1141-6545 is now almost as powerful. We also comment on the possible scalar-field effects for the detection of gravitational waves with future interferometers. The presence of a scalar partner to the graviton might be detectable with the LISA space experiment, but we already know that it would have a negligible effect for LIGO and VIRGO, so that the general relativistic wave templates can be used securely for these ground interferometers.},

К таким задачам относятся, например, исследование точности многоканальных авто­ матических систем при учете перекрестной связи каналов, исследование динамики некоторых нелинейных экстремальных самонастраивающихся систем, находящихся под действием случайных возмущений, исследование случайных колебаний упругих систем при учете нелинейных факторов (восстанавливающей силы, демпфирования и инерционности), а также целый ряд других задач.

We argue that, in the case of a compactification on a simply-connected six manifold, twisted K-theory is isomorphic to a much simpler object, twisted homology. Unlike K-theory, homology can be twisted by a class of any degree and so it classifies not only D-branes but also M-branes. Twisted homology classes correspond to cycles in a certain bundle over spacetime, and branes may decay via Kachru-Pearson-Verlinde transitions only if this cycle is trivial. We provide a spectral sequence which calculates twisted homology, the kth step treats D(p-2k)-branes ending on Dp-branes.},

The basic mathematical notions allowing for a precise formulation of the theory are then summarized and it is shown how they lead to an elucidation and deeper understanding of the aforementioned problems. After stressing the equivalence between wave mechanics and the other formulations of quantum mechanics, i.e. matrix mechanics and Dirac's abstract Hilbert space formulation, we devote the second part of our paper to the latter approach: we discuss the problems and shortcomings of this formalism as well as those of the bra and ket notation introduced by Dirac in this context.

abstract = {The present work contains a complete formulation of the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism in the framework of locally covariant field theory. In the first part of the thesis the classical theory is investigated with a particular focus on the infinite dimensional character of the underlying structures. It is shown that the use of infinite dimensional differential geometry allows for a conceptually clear and elegant formulation. The construction of the BV complex is performed in a fully covariant way and we also generalize the BV framework to a more abstract level, using functors and natural transformations. In this setting we construct the BV complex for classical gravity. This allows us to give a homological interpretation to the notion of diffeomorphism invariant physical quantities in general relativity. The second part of the thesis concerns the quantum theory. We provide a framework for the BV quantization that doesn't rely on the path integral formalism, but is completely formulated within perturbative algebraic quantum field theory. To make such a formulation possible we first prove that the renormalized time-ordered product can be understood as a binary operation on a suitable domain. Using this result we prove the associativity of this product and provide a consistent framework for the renormalized BV structures. In particular the renormalized quantum master equation and the renormalized quantum BV operator are defined. To give a precise meaning to theses objects we make a use of the master Ward identity, which is an important structure in causal perturbation theory.},

These properties may emerge from the collective behaviour of simple fundamental constituents, and are studied using statistical field theories. Initial chapters connect the particulate perspective developed in the companion volume, to the coarse grained statistical fields studied here. Based on lectures taught by Professor Kardar at MIT, this textbook demonstrates how such theories are formulated and studied. Perturbation theory, exact solutions, renormalization groups, and other tools are employed to demonstrate the emergence of scale invariance and universality, and the non-equilibrium dynamics of interfaces and directed paths in random media are discussed. Ideal for advanced graduate courses in statistical physics, it contains an integrated set of problems, with solutions to selected problems at the end of the book and a complete set available to lecturers at www.cambridge.org/9780521873413.},

It has been driven by a perceived gap in the literature today. While basic undergraduate physics texts often show little or no connection with the huge explosion of research over the last two decades, more advanced and specialized texts tend to be rather daunting for students. In this series, all topics and their consequences are treated at a simple level, while pointers to recent developments are provided at various stages. The emphasis in on clear physical principles like symmetry, quantum mechanics, and electromagnetism which underlie the whole of physics. At the same time, the subjects are related to real measurements and to the experimental techniques and devices currently used by physicists in academe and industry. Books in this series are written as course books, and include ample tutorial material, examples, illustrations, revision points, and problem sets. They can likewise be used as preparation for students starting a doctorate in physics and related fields, or for recent graduates starting research in one of these fields in industry.},

abstract = {This article is based on an introductory lecture given for the past many years during the "MR Physics and Techniques for Clinicians" course at the Annual Meeting of the ISMRM. This introduction is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of the field, as the subject of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) physics is large and complex. Rather, it is intended to lay a conceptual foundation by which magnetic resonance image formation can be understood from an intuitive perspective. The presentation is nonmathematical, relying on simple models that take the reader progressively from the basic spin physics of nuclei, through descriptions of how the magnetic resonance signal is generated and detected in an MRI scanner, the foundations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation, and a discussion of the Fourier transform and its relation to MR image formation. The article continues with a discussion of how magnetic field gradients are used to facilitate spatial encoding and concludes with a development of basic pulse sequences and the factors defining image contrast.},

abstract = {This monograph presents various ongoing approaches to the vast topic of quantization, which is the process of forming a quantum mechanical system starting from a classical one, and discusses their numerous fruitful interactions with mathematics. The opening chapter introduces the various forms of quantization and their interactions with each other and with mathematics. A first approach to quantization, called deformation quantization, consists of viewing the Planck constant as a small parameter. This approach provides a deformation of the structure of the algebra of classical observables rather than a radical change in the nature of the observables. When symmetries come into play, deformation quantization needs to be merged with group actions, which is presented in chapter 2, by Simone Gutt. The noncommutativity arising from quantization is the main concern of noncommutative geometry. Allowing for the presence of symmetries requires working with principal fiber bundles in a non-commutative setup, where Hopf algebras appear naturally. This is the topic of chapter 3, by Christian Kassel. Nichols algebras, a special type of Hopf algebras, are the subject of chapter 4, by Nicol{\'{a}}s Andruskiewitsch. The purely algebraic approaches given in the previous chapters do not take the geometry of space-time into account. For this purpose a special treatment using a more geometric point of view is required. An approach to field quantization on curved space-time, with applications to cosmology, is presented in chapter 5 in an account of the lectures of Abhay Ashtekar that brings a complementary point of view to non-commutativity. An alternative quantization procedure is known under the name of string theory. In chapter 6 its supersymmetric version is presented. Superstrings have drawn the attention of many mathematicians, due to its various fruitful interactions with algebraic geometry, some of which are described here. The remaining chapters discuss further topics, as the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism and direct products of spectral triples. This volume addresses both physicists and mathematicians and serves as an introduction to ongoing research in very active areas of mathematics and physics at the border line between geometry, topology, algebra and quantum field theory.

abstract = {It has been known for some years that entanglement entropy obtained from partial trace does not provide the correct entanglement measure when applied to systems of identical particles. Several criteria have been proposed that have the drawback of being different according to whether one is dealing with fermions, bosons, or distinguishable particles. In this Letter, we give a precise and mathematically natural answer to this problem. Our approach is based on the use of the more general idea of the restriction of states to subalgebras. It leads to a novel approach to entanglement, which is suitable to be used in general quantum systems and especially in systems of identical particles. This settles some recent controversy regarding entanglement for identical particles. The prospects for applications of our criteria are wide ranging, from spin chains in condensed matter to entropy of black holes.},

A gauge group of the first kind is shown to be automatically compact if the scattering states are complete and the mass and spin multiplets have finite multiplicity. Under reasonable assumptions about the structure of F it is shown that the inequivalent irreducible representations of A ("sectors") which occur are in one-to-one correspondence with the inequivalent irreducible representations of G and that all of them are "strongly locally equivalent". An irreducible representation of A satisfies the duality property only if the sector corresponds to a 1-dimensional representation of G. If G is Abelian the sectors are connected to each other by localized automorphisms.},

While this algebraic approach is straightforward for bosons, in the case of fermions it is subtler since one has to distinguish between micro-causality, that is the anti-commutativity of the basic creation and annihilation operators, and algebraic independence that is the commutativity of local observables. We argue that a consistent algebraic formulation of separability and entanglement should be compatible with micro-causality rather than with algebraic independence.},

abstract = {In the special case of a spherically symmetric solution of Einstein equations coupled to a scalar massless field, we examine the consequences on the exact solution imposed by a semiclassical treatment of gravitational interaction when the scalar field is quantized. In agreement with Doplicheretal. (1995) [2], imposing the principle of gravitational stability against localization of events, we find that the region where an event is localized, or where initial conditions can be assigned, has a minimal extension, of the order of the Planck length. This conclusion, though limited to the case of spherical symmetry, is more general than that of [2] since it does not require the use of the notion of energy through the Heisenberg Principle, nor of any approximation as the linearized Einstein equations.We shall then describe the influence of this minimal length scale in a cosmological model, namely a simple universe filled with radiation, which is effectively described by a conformally coupled scalar field in a conformal KMS state. Solving the backreaction, a power law inflation scenario appears close to the initial singularity. Furthermore, the initial singularity becomes light like and thus the standard horizon problem is avoided in this simple model. This indication goes in the same direction as those drawn at a heuristic level from a full use of the principle of gravitational stability against localization of events, which point to a background dependence of the effective Planck length, through which a-causal effects may be transmitted. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In nonrelatistic quantum mechanics, Born's principle of localistion is as follows: For a single particle, if a wave function {\$}\backslashpsi{\_}K{\$} vanishes outside a spatial region {\$}K{\$}, it is said to be localised in {\$}K{\$}. In particular if a spatial region {\$}K'{\$} is disjoint from {\$}K{\$}, a wave function {\$}\backslashpsi{\_}{\{}K'{\}}{\$} localised in {\$}K'{\$} is orthogonal to {\$}\backslashpsi{\_}K{\$}. Such a principle of localisation does not exist compatibly with relativity and causality in quantum field theory (Newton and Wigner) or interacting point particles (Currie,Jordan and Sudarshan).It is replaced by symplectic localisation of observables as shown by Brunetti, Guido and Longo, Schroer and others. This localisation gives a simple derivation of the spin-statistics theorem and the Unruh effect, and shows how to construct quantum fields for anyons and for massless particles with `continuous' spin. This review outlines the basic principles underlying symplectic localisation and shows or mentions its deep implications. In particular, it has the potential to affect relativistic quantum information theory and black hole physics.},

Concerning these differential equations that arise from problems of variation, far more precise statements can be made than about arbitrary differential equations admitting of a group, which are the subject of Lie's researches. What is to follow, therefore, represents a combination of the methods of the formal calculus of variations with those of Lie's group theory. For special groups and problems in variation, this combination of methods is not new; I may cite Hamel and Herglotz for special finite groups, Lorentz and his pupils (for instance Fokker), Weyl and Klein for special infinite groups. Especially Klein's second Note and the present developments have been mutually influenced by each other, in which regard I may refer to the concluding remarks of Klein's Note.},

The crucial technical ingredient is a proof that the renormalized time-ordered product is equivalent to the pointwise product of classical field theory. The renormalized Batalin-Vilkovisky algebra is then the classical algebra but written in terms of the time-ordered product, together with an operator which replaces the ill defined graded Laplacian of the unrenormalized theory. We identify it with the anomaly term of the anomalous Master Ward Identity of Brennecke and D$\backslash$"utsch. Contrary to other approaches we do not refer to the path integral formalism and do not need to use regularizations in intermediate steps.},

The basic concepts and results related to the affiliation relation in the C *-algebra theory are recalled. In particular natural topologies on the set of affiliated elements and on the set of morphisms are considered. The notion of a C *-algebra generated by a finite sequence of unbounded elements is introduced and investigated. It is generalized to include continuous quantum families of generators. An essential part of the duality theory for C *-algebras is presented including complete proofs of many theorems announced in [17]. The results are used to develop a presentation method of introducing non-unital C *-algebras. Numerous examples related mainly to the quantum group theory are presented.},

A theorem which relates certain complex Lorentz transformations to the TCP transformation is stated and proved. With reference to this theorem, duality conditions are considered, and it is shown that such conditions hold under various physically reasonable assumptions about the field. A theorem analogous to Borchers' theorem on relatively local fields is stated and proved.

A dynamical model with infinite degrees of freedom that describes a Robertson-Walker universe with nonhomogeneous electromagnetic radiation is defined. Its statistical mechanics is studied by using the covariant statistical theory. A simple statistical state that represents the cosmic background radiation is constructed. The properties of this state support the general theory; in particular, the idea that a preferred time variable, denoted thermodynamical time, is singled out by the statistical state can be tested within this model. The thermodynamical time is computed and shown to agree with the standard Robertson-Walker time. In addition, an application of the general theory to a simple special relativistic system, and a proposal for an application to full general relativity are also presented. The relevance of this application for the physics of the very early universe is discussed.},

The (reduced) C*-algebra of {\$}G{\$} (as defined by A. Connes) is shown to be a strict quantization (in the sense of M. Rieffel) of {\$}g{\^{}}*{\$}. This is proved using a generalization of Weyl's quantization prescription on flat space. Many other known strict quantizations are a special case of this procedure; on a Riemannian manifold, one recovers Connes' tangent groupoid as well as a recent generalization of Weyl's prescription. When {\$}G{\$} is the gauge groupoid of a principal bundle one is led to the Weyl quantization of a particle moving in an external Yang-Mills field. In case that {\$}G{\$} is a Lie group (with Lie algebra {\$}g{\$}) one recovers Rieffel's quantization of the Lie-Poisson structure on {\$}g{\^{}}*{\$}. A transformation group C*-algebra defined by a smooth action of a Lie group on a manifold {\$}Q{\$} turns out to be the quantization of the semidirect product Poisson manifold {\$}g{\^{}}*x Q{\$} defined by this action.},

I have tried to cover all of the main aspects of “standard” or “clas- cal” operator algebra theory; the goal has been to be, well, encyclopedic.

Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition introduces the ideas and techniques of differential geometry and topology at a level suitable for postgraduate students and researchers in these fields. The second edition of this popular and established text incorporates a number of changes designed to meet the needs of the reader and reflect the development of the subject. The book features a considerably expanded first chapter, reviewing aspects of path integral quantization and gauge theories. Chapter 2 introduces the mathematical concepts of maps, vector spaces, and topology. The following chapters focus on more elaborate concepts in geometry and topology and discuss the application of these concepts to liquid crystals, superfluid helium, general relativity, and bosonic string theory. Later chapters unify geometry and topology, exploring fiber bundles, characteristic classes, and index theorems. New to this second edition is the proof of the index theorem in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The final two chapters are devoted to the most fascinating applications of geometry and topology in contemporary physics, namely the study of anomalies in gauge field theories and the analysis of Polakov's bosonic string theory from the geometrical point of view. Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition is an ideal introduction to differential geometry and topology for postgraduate students and researchers in theoretical and mathematical physics.},

@article{Kibble1961,
abstract = {An argument leading from the Lorentz invariance of the Lagrangian to the introduction of the gravitational field is presented. Utiyama{\&}apos;s discussion is extended by considering the 10‐parameter group of inhomogeneous Lorentz transformations, involving variation of the coordinates as well as the field variables. It is then unnecessary to introduce a priori curvilinear coordinates or a Riemannian metric, and the new field variables introduced as a consequence of the argument include the vierbein components hk $\mu$ as well as the ``local affine connection{\&}apos;{\&}apos; Ai j$\mu$ . The extended transformations for which the 10 parameters become arbitrary functions of position may be interpreted as general coordinate transformations and rotations of the vierbein system. The free Lagrangian for the new fields is shown to be a function of two covariant quantities analogous to F$\mu$$\nu$ for the electromagnetic field, and the simplest possible form is just the usual curvature scalar density expressed in terms of hk $\mu$ and Ai j$\mu$ . This Lagrangian is of first order in the derivatives, and is the analog for the vierbein formalism of Palatini{\&}apos;s Lagrangian. In the absence of matter, it yields the familiar equationsR$\mu$$\nu$ =0 for empty space, but when matter is present there is a difference from the usual theory (first pointed out by Weyl) which arises from the fact that Ai j$\mu$ appears in the matter field Lagrangian, so that the equation of motion relating Ai j$\mu$ to hk $\mu$ is changed. In particular, this means that, although the covariant derivative of the metric vanishes, the affine connection $\Gamma$$\lambda$ $\mu$$\nu$ is nonsymmetric. The theory may be reexpressed in terms of the Christoffel connection, and in that case additional terms quadratic in the ``spin density{\&}apos;{\&}apos; Sk ij appear in the Lagrangian. These terms are almost certainly too small to make any experimentally detectable difference to the predictions of the usual metric theory.},

abstract = {This text presents a graduate-level introduction to differential geometry for mathematics and physics students. The exposition follows the historical development of the concepts of connection and curvature with the goal of explaining the Chern-Weil theory of characteristic classes on a principal bundle. Along the way we encounter some of the high points in the history of differential geometry, for example, Gauss' Theorema Egregium and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Exercises throughout the book test the reader's understanding of the material and sometimes illustrate extensions of the theory. Initially, the prerequisites for the reader include a passing familiarity with manifolds. After the first chapter, it becomes necessary to understand and manipulate differential forms. A knowledge of de Rham cohomology is required for the last third of the text. Prerequisite material is contained in author's text An Introduction to Manifolds, and can be learned in one semester. For the benefit of the reader and to establish common notations, Appendix A recalls the basics of manifold theory. Additionally, in an attempt to make the exposition more self-contained, sections on algebraic constructions such as the tensor product and the exterior power are included. Differential geometry, as its name implies, is the study of geometry using differential calculus. It dates back to Newton and Leibniz in the seventeenth century, but it was not until the nineteenth century, with the work of Gauss on surfaces and Riemann on the curvature tensor, that differential geometry flourished and its modern foundation was laid. Over the past one hundred years, differential geometry has proven indispensable to an understanding of the physical world, in Einstein's general theory of relativity, in the theory of gravitation, in gauge theory, and now in string theory. Differential geometry is also useful in topology, several complex variables, algebraic geometry, complex manifolds, and dynamical systems, among other fields. The field has even found applications to group theory as in Gromov's work and to probability theory as in Diaconis's work. It is not too far-fetched to argue that differential geometry should be in every mathematician's arsenal. Preface -- Chapter 1. Curvature and Vector Fields -- 1. Riemannian Manifolds -- 2.

abstract = {It is shown that there are significant conceptual differences between QM and QFT which make it difficult to view the latter as just a relativistic extension of the principles of QM. At the root of this is a fundamental distiction between Born-localization in QM (which in the relativistic context changes its name to Newton-Wigner localization) and modular localization which is the localization underlying QFT, after one separates it from its standard presentation in terms of field coordinates. The first comes with a probability notion and projection operators, whereas the latter describes causal propagation in QFT and leads to thermal aspects of locally reduced finite energy states. The Born-Newton-Wigner localization in QFT is only applicable asymptotically and the covariant correlation between asymptotic in and out localization projectors is the basis of the existence of an invariant scattering matrix.In this first part of a two part essay the modular localization (the intrinsic content of field localization) and its philosophical consequences take the center stage. Important physical consequences of vacuum polarization will be the main topic of part II. The present division into two semi-autonomous essays is the result of a partition and extension of an originally one-part manuscript. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the book of Haag [Local Quantum Physics (Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1992)] about local quantum field theory the main results are obtained by the older methods of C * - and W * -algebra theory. A great advance, especially in the theory of W * -algebras, is due to Tomita's discovery of the theory of modular Hilbert algebras [Quasi-standard von Neumann algebras, Preprint (1967)]. Because of the abstract nature of the underlying concepts, this theory became (except for some sporadic results) a technique for quantum field theory only in the beginning of the nineties. In this review the results obtained up to this point will be collected and some problems for the future will be discussed at the end. In the first section the technical tools will be presented. Then in the second section two concepts, the half-sided translations and the half-sided modular inclusions, will be explained. These concepts have revolutionized the handling of quantum field theory. Examples for which the modular groups are explicitly known are presented in the third section. One of the important results of the new theory is the proof of the PCT theorem in the theory of local observables. Questions connected with the proof are discussed in Sec. IV. Section V deals with the structure of local algebras and with questions connected with symmetry groups. In Sec. VI a theory of tensor product decompositions will be presented. In the last section problems that are closely connected with the modular theory and that should be treated in the future will be discussed.},

abstract = {Coherence and correlations represent two related properties of a compound system. The system can be, for instance, the polarization of a photon, which forms part of a polarization-entangled two-photon state, or the spatial shape of a coherent beam, where each spatial mode bears different polarizations. Whereas a local unitary transformation of the system does not affect its coherence, global unitary transformations modifying both the system and its surroundings can enhance its coherence, transforming mutual correlations into coherence. The question naturally arises of what is the best measure that quantifies the correlations that can be turned into coherence, and how much coherence can be extracted. We answer both questions, and illustrate its application for some typical simple systems, with the aim at illuminating the general concept of enhancing coherence by modifying correlations.},

@article{Gorni2014,
abstract = {In this paper we revisit Noether's theorem on the constants of motion for Lagrangian mechanical systems in the ODE case, with some new perspectives on both the theoretical and the applied side. We make full use of invariance up to a divergence, or, as we call it here, Bessel-Hagen (BH) invariance. By recognizing that the Bessel-Hagen (BH) function need not be a total time derivative, we can easily deduce nonlocal constants of motion. We prove that we can always trivialize either the time change or the BH-function, so that, in particular, BH-invariance turns out not to be more general than Noether's original invariance. We also propose a version of time change that simplifies some key formulas. Applications include Lane-Emden equation, dissipative systems, homogeneous potentials and superintegrable systems. Most notably, we give two derivations of the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector for Kepler's problem that require space and time change only, without BH invariance, one with and one without use of the Lagrange equation.},

abstract = {String Theory comprises two volumes which give a comprehensive and pedagogic account of the subject. Volume 1, first published in 1998, provides a thorough introduction to the bosonic string. The first four chapters introduce the central ideas of string theory, the tools of conformal field theory and of the Polyakov path integral, and the covariant quantization of the string. The next three chapters treat string interactions: the general formalism, and detailed treatments of the tree level and one loop amplitudes. Chapter eight covers toroidal compactification and many important aspects of string physics, such as T-duality and D-branes. Chapter nine treats higher-order amplitudes, including an analysis of their finiteness and unitarity, and various nonperturbative ideas. An appendix giving a short course on path integral methods is included. This is an essential text and reference for graduate students and researchers interested in modern superstring theory.},

This combination leads to the appearance of ten fundamental quantities for each dynamical system, namely the total energy, the total momentum and the 6-vector which has three components equal to the total angular momentum. The usual form of dynamics expresses everything in terms of dynamical variables at one instant of time, which results in specially simple expressions for six or these ten, namely the components of momentum and of angular momentum. There are other forms for relativistic dynamics in which others of the ten are specially simple, corresponding to various sub-groups of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group.

Under reasonable assumptions about the structure of F it is shown that the inequivalent irreducible representations of A ("sectors") which occur are in one-to-one correspondence with the inequivalent irreducible representations of G and that all of them are "strongly locally equivalent". An irreducible representation of A satisfies the duality property only if the sector corresponds to a 1-dimensional representation of G.

Among other things: (a) the key idea of relative Cauchy evolution is described in detail, and related to the stress-energy tensor; (b) a systematic "rigidity argument" is used to generalise results from flat to curved spacetimes; (c) a detailed discussion of the issue of selection of physical states is given, linking notions of stability at microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic scales; (d) the notion of subtheories and global gauge transformations are formalised; (e) it is shown that the general framework excludes the possibility of there being a single preferred state in each spacetime, if the choice of states is local and covariant. Many of the ideas are illustrated by the example of the free Klein-Gordon theory, which is given a new "universal definition".},

@article{Strocchi2013,
abstract = {Quantum Field Theory (QFT) has proved to be the most useful strategy for the description of elementary particle interactions and as such is regarded as a fundamental part of modern theoretical physics. In most presentations, the emphasis is on the effectiveness of the theory in producing experimentally testable predictions, which at present essentially means Perturbative QFT. However, after more than fifty years of QFT, we still are in the embarrassing situation of not knowing a single non-trivial (even non-realistic) model of QFT in 3+1 dimensions, allowing a non-perturbative control. As a reaction to these consistency problems one may take the position that they are related to our ignorance of the physics of small distances and that QFT is only an effective theory, so that radically new ideas are needed for a consistent quantum theory of relativistic interactions (in 3+1 dimensions).The book starts by discussing the conflict between locality or hyperbolicity and positivity of the energy for relativistic wave equations, which marks the origin of quantum field theory, and the mathematical problems of the perturbative expansion (canonical quantization, interaction picture, non-Fock representation, asymptotic convergence of the series etc.). The general physical principles of positivity of the energy, Poincare' covariance and locality provide a substitute for canonical quantization, qualify the non-perturbative foundation and lead to very relevant results, like the Spin-statistics theorem, TCP symmetry, a substitute for canonical quantization, non-canonical behaviour, the euclidean formulation at the basis of the functional integral approach, the non-perturbative definition of the S-matrix (LSZ, Haag-Ruelle-Buchholz theory).A characteristic feature of gauge field theories is Gauss' law constraint. It is responsible for the conflict between locality of the charged fields and positivity, it yields the superselection of the (unbroken) gauge charges, provides a non-perturbative explanation of the Higgs mechanism in the local gauges, implies the infraparticle structure of the charged particles in QED and the breaking of the Lorentz group in the charged sectors.A non-perturbative proof of the Higgs mechanism is discussed in the Coulomb gauge: the vector bosons corresponding to the broken generators are massive and their two point function dominates the Goldstone spectrum, thus excluding the occurrence of massless Goldstone bosons.The solution of the U(1) problem in QCD, the theta vacuum structure and the inevitable breaking of the chiral symmetry in each theta sector are derived solely from the topology of the gauge group, without relying on the semiclassical instanton approximation.},

Secondly, in the quantum logic formalism, I emphasize which axioms for the lattice of propositions (existence of an orthocomplementation and the covering property) derive from reversibility. A new argument based on locality and Soler's theorem is used to derive the representation as projectors on a regular Hilbert space from the general quantum logic formalism. In both cases it is recalled that the restriction to complex algebras and Hilbert spaces comes from the constraints of locality and separability.},

abstract = {Geometric phases, arising from cyclic evolutions in a curved parameter space, appear in a wealth of physical settings. Recently, and largely motivated by the need of an experimentally realistic definition for quantum computing applications, the quantum geometric phase was generalized to open systems. The definition takes a kinematical approach, with an initial state that is evolved cyclically but coupled to an environment--leading to a correction of the geometric phase with respect to the uncoupled case. We obtain this correction by measuring the nonunitary evolution of the reduced density matrix of a spin one-half coupled to an environment. In particular we are interested in baths near a quantum phase transition, which are known to induce strong decoherence. The experiments are done with a NMR quantum simulator, where we emulate qualitatively the influence of a critical environment using a simple one-qubit model.},

While the answer is affirmative in the qualitative sense, the situation is less clear if monogamy is intended as a quantitative limitation on the distribution of bipartite entanglement in a multipartite system, given some particular measure of entanglement. Here, we formalize what it takes for a bipartite measure of entanglement to obey a general quantitative monogamy relation on all quantum states. We then prove that an important class of entanglement measures fail to be monogamous in this general sense of the term, with monogamy violations becoming generic with increasing dimension. In particular, we show that every additive and suitably normalized entanglement measure cannot satisfy any nontrivial general monogamy relation while at the same time faithfully capturing the geometric entanglement structure of the fully antisymmetric state in arbitrary dimension. Nevertheless, monogamy of such entanglement measures can be recovered if one allows for dimension-dependent relations, as we show explicitly with relevant examples.},

Our architecture requires only two Majoranas to encode a fermionic quantum degree of freedom, compared to alternative implementations which require a minimum of four Majoranas for a spin quantum degree of freedom. The fermionic degrees of freedom support both unitary coupled cluster variational quantum eigensolver and quantum phase estimation algorithms, proposed for quantum chemistry simulations. Because we avoid the Jordan-Wigner transformation, our scheme has a lower overhead for implementing both of these algorithms, and the simulation of Trotterized Hubbard Hamiltonian in {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(1){\$} time per unitary step.

In contrast to more standard treatments, Hilbert space is an emergent concept, appearing as a representation space of the observable algebra, once a state is chosen. In this approach, which is based on the Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal construction, the study of subsystems becomes particularly clear. We explicitly show how the problems associated with the partial trace for the study of entanglement of identical particles are readily overcome. In particular, a suitable entanglement measure is proposed that can be applied to systems of particles obeying Fermi, Bose, para-, and even braid-group statistics. The generality of the method is also illustrated by study of the time evolution of subsystems emerging from restriction to subalgebras. Problems related to anomalies and quantum epistemology are also discussed. DOI:},

These are in general different. Therefore one reaches the remarkable possibility that there may be many entropies for a given state [Private communication from R. Sorkin]. This ambiguity in entropy can often be traced to a gauge symmetry emergent from the non-trivial topological character of the configuration space of the underlying system. It can also happen in finite-dimensional matrix models. In the present work, we discuss this entropy ambiguity and its consequences for an ethylene molecule. This is a very simple and well-known system where these notions can be put to tests. Besides its intrinsic conceptual interest, the simplicity of this model can serve as an introduction to a similar discussion of systems such as coloured monopoles and the breaking of colour symmetry.},

We demonstrate that the distillable entanglement is zero for pure Abelian gauge theories at zero gauge coupling, while it is in general nonzero for the non-Abelian case.

Instantaneous measurement of these observables is known to be a difficult problem, especially when the measurements are projective. The standard von Neumann Hamiltonian used to model projective measurements cannot be implemented directly in a non-local scenario and can, in some cases, violate causality. We present a scheme for effectively generating the von Neumann Hamiltonian for non-local observables without the need to communicate and adapt. The protocol can be used to perform weak and strong (projective) measurements, as well as measurements at any intermediate strength. It can also be used in practical situations beyond non-local measurements. We show how the protocol can be used to probe a version of Hardy's paradox with both weak and strong measurements. The outcomes of these measurements provide a non-intuitive picture of the pre- and post-selected system.

abstract = {In a quantum system, there may be many density matrices associated with a state on an algebra of observables. For each density matrix, one can compute its entropy. These are in general different. Therefore one reaches the remarkable possibility that there may be many entropies for a given state [Private communication from R. Sorkin]. This ambiguity in entropy can often be traced to a gauge symmetry emergent from the non-trivial topological character of the configuration space of the underlying system. It can also happen in finite-dimensional matrix models. In the present work, we discuss this entropy ambiguity and its consequences for an ethylene molecule. This is a very simple and well-known system where these notions can be put to tests. Besides its intrinsic conceptual interest, the simplicity of this model can serve as an introduction to a similar discussion of systems such as coloured monopoles and the breaking of colour symmetry.},

The capability of controlling our channel allows us to visualize its effects in a quantum system. Differently from standard dephasing channels, our channel presents an exotic behavior in the sense that the evolution of a state, from a pure to a mixed state, shows an oscillatory behavior if tracked in the Bloch sphere. Additionally, we report the evolution of the purity and perform a quantum process tomography to obtain the $\backslash$chi matrix associated to our channel.},

This allows a purely algebraic formulation of the theory. The framework of an algebraic version of quantum field theory is discussed and compared to the customary operator approach. It is pointed out that one reason (and possibly the only one) for the existence of unitarily inequivalent faithful, irreducible representations in quantum field theory is the (physically irrelevant) behavior of the states with respect to observations made infinitely far away. The separation between such ``global{\&}apos;{\&}apos; features and the local ones is studied. An application of this point of view to superselection rules shows that, for example, in electrodynamics the Hilbert space of states with charge zero carries already all the relevant physical information.},

However, this difficulty may be overcome by using some controllable quantum system to study another less controllable or accessible quantum system, i.e., quantum simulation. Quantum simulation promises to have applications in the study of many problems in, e.g., condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, atomic physics, quantum chemistry and cosmology. Quantum simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also with simpler, analog devices that would require less control, and therefore, would be easier to con- struct. A number of quantum systems such as neutral atoms, ions, polar molecules, electrons in semiconductors, superconducting circuits, nuclear spins and photons have been proposed as quan- tum simulators.

abstract = {In the book of Haag [Local Quantum Physics (Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1992)] about local quantum field theory the main results are obtained by the older methods of C * - and W * -algebra theory. A great advance, especially in the theory of W * -algebras, is due to Tomita's discovery of the theory of modular Hilbert algebras [Quasi-standard von Neumann algebras, Preprint (1967)]. Because of the abstract nature of the underlying concepts, this theory became (except for some sporadic results) a technique for quantum field theory only in the beginning of the nineties. In this review the results obtained up to this point will be collected and some problems for the future will be discussed at the end. In the first section the technical tools will be presented. Then in the second section two concepts, the half-sided translations and the half-sided modular inclusions, will be explained. These concepts have revolutionized the handling of quantum field theory. Examples for which the modular groups are explicitly known are presented in the third section. One of the important results of the new theory is the proof of the PCT theorem in the theory of local observables. Questions connected with the proof are discussed in Sec. IV. Section V deals with the structure of local algebras and with questions connected with symmetry groups. In Sec. VI a theory of tensor product decompositions will be presented. In the last section problems that are closely connected with the modular theory and that should be treated in the future will be discussed.},

In contrast to more standard treatments, Hilbert space is an emergent concept, appearing as a representation space of the observable algebra, once a state is chosen. In this approach, which is based on the Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal construction, the study of subsystems becomes particularly clear. We explicitly show how the problems associated with the partial trace for the study of entanglement of identical particles are readily overcome. In particular, a suitable entanglement measure is proposed that can be applied to systems of particles obeying Fermi, Bose, para-, and even braid-group statistics. The generality of the method is also illustrated by study of the time evolution of subsystems emerging from restriction to subalgebras. Problems related to anomalies and quantum epistemology are also discussed. DOI:},

@article{Balachandran2013a,
abstract = {It has been known for some years that entanglement entropy obtained from partial trace does not provide the correct entanglement measure when applied to systems of identical particles. Several criteria have been proposed that have the drawback of being different according to whether one is dealing with fermions, bosons, or distinguishable particles. In this Letter, we give a precise and mathematically natural answer to this problem. Our approach is based on the use of the more general idea of the restriction of states to subalgebras. It leads to a novel approach to entanglement, which is suitable to be used in general quantum systems and especially in systems of identical particles. This settles some recent controversy regarding entanglement for identical particles. The prospects for applications of our criteria are wide ranging, from spin chains in condensed matter to entropy of black holes.},
